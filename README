This software consists of a simple web server (/server) and a script single
script in /cgi-bin. The server exposed a single endpoint (host:8000/cgi-bin/health_check.py). 
The server can be started using the following.

$ python /server/init.py

This is also where the port is define. The default is 8000. Upon receiving a request, the
server executes /cgi-bin/healh_check.py. This returns with a status code of 0 is all
collections are healthy, and a some non-zero code if at least one collection is unhealthy. 
The server will send 200 OK and 500 Server Error for the former and latter cases, respectively.
The AWS load balancer interprets 200 as 'inService' and anything else as 'outOfService.'

The collections to be checked and how they are checked can be configured in the script itself.
By default it checks all of them using the SolR CLI 'healtheck' command.
